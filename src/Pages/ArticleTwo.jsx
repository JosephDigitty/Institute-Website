        Leadership, administration and management are interchangeably used and apportioned first-line 
        blame at the failure or inefficiency of a system, an organization and a state. This is no news 
        and strange as Nigeria is a case in point. This era of rapid technological transformation and 
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is adding a different dimension to the challenges of leading, 
        managing and administering. This function (Leadership or Management or Administration) aims to 
        ensure that organizational or societal goals are properly set and attained efficiently to guarantee 
        sustainability. Performing this function has been a daunting challenge that requires certain skills 
        define by time and relevance.
        <br />
        In the 20th century, the capacity to manage requires basic management skills of planning, budgeting,
         communication. These basic relevant skills were obsolete time as the 21st century arrived. 
         The 21st century skills required of Managers to diligently perform their functions have changed 
         and still undergoing modification and transformation given the changes in the experiences of the century. 
         growth.
        <br />
        To be an efficient manager, administrator or leader, one must not only keep abreast with these 
        changes and skills demands but must understand and acquire these skills to be useful and relevant. 
        To this end and as usual this topic is timely for the Chartered Institute of Public Diplomacy and 
        Management (CIPDM) and for the sustainability of the Diplomacy and Management Profession.

            For most of history, diplomacy was concerned with bilateral relations, or negotiations 
            between two nations. A country or region often had dozens of trade or border agreements, 
            each limited to a single other country or region. In the 20th century, diplomacy expanded. 
            Today, the United Nations (UN), an international organization that works to promote cooperation 
            and settle conflicts among nations, plays a large role in diplomacy. Diplomacy is concerned 
            with multi-lateral relationships (Edersheim, 2007). In the 21st century Diplomacy expanded 
            to include summit meetings and International conferences. Summits are meetings between top 
            government officials. Summits can be between national leaders, such as presidents or prime 
            ministers. 
            <br />
            Economic summits often involve business leaders, as well as treasury secretaries or trade 
            ministers. International conferences are usually attended by heads-of-state or other national 
            leaders. Conferences are usually much larger in scopeâ€”dozens of leaders may meet to discuss 
            migration or border issues, trade, or the environment. These meetings recognize the rights, 
            strengths and need countries and form the basis for reaching a mutual understanding.

            History of Diplomacy
            </p>
            Diplomacy is about the recognition of the rights and strengths of parties in a relationship 
            and the implications of such rights and strength in sustainability of the entity in question 
            (a nation, an organization or and enterprise). Diplomacy is accomplished by negotiation, or 
            bargaining. Usually, each group in a negotiation will ask for more than they expect to get. 
            They then compromise, or give up some of what they want, in order to come to an agreement. 
            Often, an outside diplomat will help with the negotiations. For example, Martti Ahtisaari, 
            a Finnish diplomat working for the UN, helped Namibia gain independence from South Africa in 1990. 
            <br />
            Negotiation is a critical skill for leaders, as it enables them to navigate complex situations, 
            resolve conflicts, and reach mutually beneficial agreements. In the fast-paced business world, 
            mastering the art of negotiation can be a valuable asset for leaders seeking to drive innovation 
            and collaboration. Effective negotiation is essential for fostering strong relationships, 
            achieving desired outcomes, and creating win-win scenarios
